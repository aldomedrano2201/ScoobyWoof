	<h1>ScoobyWoof App</h1>
	<p>This is a dog walking app designed to connect dog walkers with dog owners in need of their services. The app has two main roles: dog walker and dog owner.</p>

<h2>Dog Walker Role</h2>
<p>As a dog walker, you can create a profile that includes information about your experience with dogs, your availability, and your rates. Once your profile is complete, you will be able to view and accept dog walking requests from dog owners in your area. You will also be able to communicate with dog owners through the app to coordinate walks and provide updates.</p>

<h2>Dog Owner Role</h2>
<p>As a dog owner, you can create a profile that includes information about your dog(s), your location, and your desired walking schedule. You will be able to search for dog walkers in your area and send them walking requests. Once a dog walker accepts your request, you will be able to communicate with them through the app to coordinate walks and provide any necessary information about your dog(s).</p>

<h2>App Features</h2>

	<li>User authentication for secure login</li>
